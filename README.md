<p>I'm a Materials Engineer that discovered a passion for programming after graduating from college and working in the aerospace industry with my degree. I love working on complex programming problems; to me its like solving puzzles and in my time as a developer have found myself constantly having a blast working on such problems. Programming to me is a never-ending learning experience, and I love that there is always something new to learn and that every problem can lead to a new learning opportunity. A majority of my work is with Python, and while i've picked up on some other languages over time, my focus has mainly been on backend development with Django and the Django REST framework. I'm all about a good REST API.</p>
 
<p>My goal is to have a career in software development. I try my best every day to do some coding, even if it's just for a bit, and my aspiration is to be a part of a team of passionate and talented engineers with whom I learn and share my own passion with.</p>
