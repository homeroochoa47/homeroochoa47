<h1>Hi, Homero here!</h1>
 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/homero-ochoa-047/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" alt="LinkedIn Badge"></a>
 
<p>I'm a Materials Engineer that discovered a passion for programming after graduating from college and working in the aerospace industry with my degree. Since then I've become a self-taught web developer doing freelance work for small businesses in various industries. I currently use a Jamstack structure for my sites consisting of **NextJS** on the frontend and **Sanity CMS** on the backend. 

I currently manage my whole development process from start to finish, beginning with designs in Figma all the way through hosting and management for clients. It's a good amount of work, but I find the variety in roles to be a ton of fun to work on. 
</p>
 
<p>While I sort out my career, I'll be freelancing and putting together a portfolio of clients and sites, which I'm totally on board with for now as its been a ton of fun working with clients and learning on my own schedule. However, I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and experience something new!</p>

- ðŸŒ± My apologies for the lack of commits on here; While I code just about every single day, I don't always get the chance to commit my work for the day. Definitely a bad habit that I'm trying to break out of!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a client site, as well as planning out how to start a business and building a portfolio site (coming soon!).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music! I'm a huge music person and I can talk music all day long.
